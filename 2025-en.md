Creating Acrylic Stands and Keychains with Scratch: From Paint Editor to Laser Cutting

## Short Description (450 characters max)

Create design data for acrylic stands and keychains using Scratch's Paint Editor. This method replaces complex vector software with Scratch and a simple web tool "Gazou Magick." Import images, create cut lines, and design basesâ€”all in Scratch without extensions. Share templates through Scratch studios for collaborative creation. Experience how familiar Scratch tools can bridge digital design and physical making.

## Detailed Description (950 characters max)

Specialized design software often creates barriers in digital fabrication education. This presentation demonstrates how Scratch's Paint Editor can replace complex vector software like Inkscape through its intuitive interface.

Using only Scratch's Paint Editor and a laser cutter, I'll showcase the complete process of creating acrylic stands and keychains with these key techniques:

1. Utilizing vector mode for precise line drawings
2. Separating cut lines from printing data using costume copy
3. Converting designs to laser-cutter-ready files via "Gazou Magick"
4. Creating proper cut lines (0.01px strokes) and designing bases

The method leverages Scratch's collaborative features, allowing template sharing through studios for easy classroom collaboration. No specialized software installation is needed, making it accessible to anyone with Scratch.

I'll demonstrate examples from Aoyama Gakuin University's Tsukumana Lab, where this method is used by a diverse community from elementary school students to faculty. Through actual product demonstrations, participants will discover how this approach effectively bridges digital and physical creation in educational settings.

## Session Goal

Participants will understand how to use Scratch's Paint Editor for digital fabrication and be able to apply this method in their educational practices.
