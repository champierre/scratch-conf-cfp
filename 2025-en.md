Creating Acrylic Stands and Keychains with Scratch: From Paint Editor to Laser Cutting

## Short Description (450 characters max)

Learn how to create design data for acrylic stands and keychains using Scratch's Paint Editor. Instead of complex vector software like Inkscape, this method uses only Scratch and a web tool "Gazou Magick." You can handle everything from importing images to creating cut lines entirely in Scratch, with no extensions needed. Templates can be shared through Scratch studios, enabling collaborative creation. Discover how to bridge digital design and physical making using familiar Scratch tools.

## Detailed Description (950 characters max)

Digital fabrication is gaining attention in educational settings, but the complexity of specialized design software creates barriers. While vector drawing software like Inkscape offers powerful features, its interface can be overwhelming for beginners. In contrast, Scratch's Paint Editor provides an intuitive interface that children and adults can easily use.

In this presentation, I'll demonstrate the complete process of creating design data for acrylic stands and keychains using only Scratch's Paint Editor, and producing them with a laser cutter. I'll focus on these key points:

1. Using Scratch's vector mode for precise line drawings
2. Techniques for separating cut lines from printing data
3. Exporting SVG files and converting them to PDF using the web-based "Gazou Magick" tool
4. Tips for designing bases that match acrylic sheet thickness

I'll show how Scratch can replace all the processes traditionally done in Inkscape: importing images, sizing, positioning, creating cut lines, and designing bases. I'll share practical techniques such as setting line thickness to 0.02 to create 0.01px strokes recognized as cutting lines by laser cutters, and using the costume copy feature to efficiently separate printing data from cutting data.

The greatest advantage of this approach is leveraging Scratch's collaborative features. Templates can be shared as projects and managed in studios, making collaborative work in classrooms and workshops easier. Additionally, the method doesn't require installing specialized software, making it accessible on any computer.

During the presentation, I'll showcase examples from the Aoyama Gakuin University Tsukumana Lab, a fab space utilized by a diverse community ranging from elementary school students to university students and faculty members, where creating acrylic stands and keychains is particularly popular. I'll demonstrate samples of actual acrylic stands and keychains created with this method, exploring the possibilities of creative learning activities that bridge digital and physical creation. Participants can apply this approach to make digital fabrication activities in educational settings more inclusive and approachable.

## Session Goal

Participants will understand how to use Scratch's Paint Editor for digital fabrication and be able to apply this method in their educational practices.
