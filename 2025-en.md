Creating Acrylic Stands and Keychains with Scratch: From Paint Editor to Laser Cutting

## Short Description (450 characters max)

Create design data for acrylic stands and keychains using Scratch's Paint Editor. This method replaces complex vector software with Scratch and a simple web tool "Gazou Magick." Import images, create cut lines, and design basesâ€”all in Scratch without extensions. Share templates through Scratch studios for collaborative creation. Experience how familiar Scratch tools can bridge digital design and physical making.

## Detailed Description (950 characters max)

While digital fabrication gains popularity in education, specialized design software often creates barriers for beginners. This presentation demonstrates how Scratch's Paint Editor can replace complex vector software like Inkscape, making digital fabrication more accessible through its intuitive interface.

I'll showcase the complete process of creating acrylic stands and keychains using only Scratch's Paint Editor and a laser cutter, focusing on key techniques:

1. Utilizing vector mode for precise line drawings
2. Separating cut lines from printing data using costume copy
3. Converting designs to laser-cutter-ready files via "Gazou Magick"
4. Creating proper cut lines (0.01px strokes) and designing bases

What sets this method apart is its integration with Scratch's collaborative features. Templates can be shared through studios, enabling easy collaboration in educational settings. The approach requires no specialized software installation, making it accessible to anyone with Scratch.

I'll present examples from Aoyama Gakuin University's Tsukumana Lab, where this method is successfully used by a diverse community from elementary school students to faculty members. Through demonstrations of actual products, participants will discover how this approach bridges digital and physical creation, making digital fabrication more inclusive and approachable in educational settings.

## Session Goal

Participants will understand how to use Scratch's Paint Editor for digital fabrication and be able to apply this method in their educational practices.
