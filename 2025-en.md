Creating Acrylic Stands and Keychains using Scratch: From Paint Editor to Laser Cutting

## Short Description (450 characters max)

Create design data for acrylic stands and keychains using Scratch's Paint Editor. This method replaces complex vector software with Scratch and a simple web tool "Gazou Magick." Import images, create cut lines, and design basesâ€”all in Scratch without extensions. Share templates through Scratch studios for collaborative creation. Experience how familiar Scratch tools can bridge digital design and physical making.

## Detailed Description (950 characters max)

This presentation shows how Scratch's Paint Editor can replace complex vector software for digital fabrication. Using the Paint Editor and a laser cutter, I'll demonstrate creating acrylic stands and keychains with these techniques:

1. Utilizing vector mode for precise line drawings
2. Separating cut lines from printing data using costume copy
3. Converting designs to laser-cutter-ready files via "Gazou Magick"
4. Creating cut lines and designing bases

The method leverages Scratch's collaborative features through studios, enabling easy classroom implementation without specialized software.

I'll showcase examples from Aoyama Creative Learning Laboratory, where students and faculty use this method. Through product demonstrations, participants will see how this approach bridges digital and physical creation in education.

## Session Goal

Participants will understand how to use Scratch's Paint Editor for digital fabrication and be able to apply this method in their educational practices.
